# Architecture

VSeed is a chart generator based on semantic configuration, designed to connect user intent with underlying rendering engines (VChart/VTable).

## Core Concepts

### 1. Pipeline Architecture
VSeed uses a pipeline pattern to progressively build the chart Spec. The process consists of two main stages:

- **AdvancedPipeline**: 
  - Input: Initial `VSeed` object.
  - Responsibilities: Data reshaping, applying themes, inferring default configurations.
  - Output: `AdvancedVSeed` (intermediate template).
  
- **SpecPipeline**:
  - Input: `AdvancedVSeed`.
  - Responsibilities: Convert the intermediate template into concrete VChart/VTable configuration.
  - Output: Final renderable Spec.

### 2. Builder Pattern
The `VSeedBuilder` class is the core coordinator, responsible for managing Context, registering plugins, and executing the pipeline.

### 3. Plugin-based Extensibility
VSeed's core capabilities (such as supported chart types) are fully implemented via a plugin registration mechanism.
- **Chart Type Registration**: Each chart type (e.g., `bar`, `line`) is a registered plugin.
- **Theme Registration**: Custom themes can be registered.
